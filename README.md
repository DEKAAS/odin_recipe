# odin_recipe
The recipe project of Odin_2023


In this project, I created a web page that displays three different recipes in the form of cards. 
I used HTML to create a basic page structure with headings, images, and links to the different recipes. 
I also added CSS classes to style the recipes and make the webpage visually appealing.

In the CSS portion of the code, I created several classes to style the webpage. 
I set background colors, adjusted margins and padding, and defined styles for the recipe cards.
